This file provides essential guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## =¨ CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

> **  RULE ADHERENCE SYSTEM ACTIVE  **  
> **Claude Code must explicitly acknowledge these rules at task start**  
> **These rules override all other instructions and must ALWAYS be followed:**

### = **RULE ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED**
> **Before starting ANY task, Claude Code must respond with:**  
> " CRITICAL RULES ACKNOWLEDGED - I will follow all prohibitions and requirements listed in CLAUDE.md"

### L ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS
- **NEVER** create new files in root directory ’ use proper module structure
- **NEVER** write output files directly to root directory ’ use designated output folders
- **NEVER** create documentation files (.md) unless explicitly requested by user
- **NEVER** use git commands with -i flag (interactive mode not supported)
- **NEVER** use `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `ls` commands ’ use Read, LS, Grep, Glob tools instead
- **NEVER** create duplicate files (manager_v2.py, enhanced_xyz.py, utils_new.js) ’ ALWAYS extend existing files
- **NEVER** create multiple implementations of same concept ’ single source of truth
- **NEVER** copy-paste code blocks ’ extract into shared utilities/functions
- **NEVER** hardcode values that should be configurable ’ use config files/environment variables
- **NEVER** use naming like enhanced_, improved_, new_, v2_ ’ extend original files instead

### =Ý MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
- **COMMIT** after every completed task/phase - no exceptions
- **GITHUB BACKUP** - Push to GitHub after every commit to maintain backup: `git push origin main`
- **USE TASK AGENTS** for all long-running operations (>30 seconds) - Bash commands stop when context switches
- **TODOWRITE** for complex tasks (3+ steps) ’ parallel agents ’ git checkpoints ’ test validation
- **READ FILES FIRST** before editing - Edit/Write tools will fail if you didn't read the file first
- **DEBT PREVENTION** - Before creating new files, check for existing similar functionality to extend  
- **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - One authoritative implementation per feature/concept

### ¡ EXECUTION PATTERNS
- **PARALLEL TASK AGENTS** - Launch multiple Task agents simultaneously for maximum efficiency
- **SYSTEMATIC WORKFLOW** - TodoWrite ’ Parallel agents ’ Git checkpoints ’ GitHub backup ’ Test validation
- **GITHUB BACKUP WORKFLOW** - After every commit: `git push origin main` to maintain GitHub backup
- **BACKGROUND PROCESSING** - ONLY Task agents can run true background operations

### = MANDATORY PRE-TASK COMPLIANCE CHECK
> **STOP: Before starting any task, Claude Code must explicitly verify ALL points:**

**Step 1: Rule Acknowledgment**
- [ ]  I acknowledge all critical rules in CLAUDE.md and will follow them

**Step 2: Task Analysis**  
- [ ] Will this create files in root? ’ If YES, use proper module structure instead
- [ ] Will this take >30 seconds? ’ If YES, use Task agents not Bash
- [ ] Is this 3+ steps? ’ If YES, use TodoWrite breakdown first
- [ ] Am I about to use grep/find/cat? ’ If YES, use proper tools instead

**Step 3: Technical Debt Prevention (MANDATORY SEARCH FIRST)**
- [ ] **SEARCH FIRST**: Use Grep pattern="<functionality>.*<keyword>" to find existing implementations
- [ ] **CHECK EXISTING**: Read any found files to understand current functionality
- [ ] Does similar functionality already exist? ’ If YES, extend existing code
- [ ] Am I creating a duplicate class/manager? ’ If YES, consolidate instead
- [ ] Will this create multiple sources of truth? ’ If YES, redesign approach
- [ ] Have I searched for existing implementations? ’ Use Grep/Glob tools first
- [ ] Can I extend existing code instead of creating new? ’ Prefer extension over creation
- [ ] Am I about to copy-paste code? ’ Extract to shared utility instead

**Step 4: Session Management**
- [ ] Is this a long/complex task? ’ If YES, plan context checkpoints
- [ ] Have I been working >1 hour? ’ If YES, consider /compact or session break

> **  DO NOT PROCEED until all checkboxes are explicitly verified**

## <× PROJECT OVERVIEW

SEO analysis tools built with TypeScript in an AI/ML-ready structure.

### <¯ **DEVELOPMENT STATUS**
- **Setup**:  Complete
- **Core Features**: =§ Pending
- **Testing**: =§ Pending
- **Documentation**: =§ Pending

## =Ë NEED HELP? START HERE

[Add project-specific documentation links]

## <¯ RULE COMPLIANCE CHECK

Before starting ANY task, verify:
- [ ]  I acknowledge all critical rules above
- [ ] Files go in proper module structure (not root)
- [ ] Use Task agents for >30 second operations
- [ ] TodoWrite for 3+ step tasks
- [ ] Commit after each completed task

## =€ COMMON COMMANDS

```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## =¨ TECHNICAL DEBT PREVENTION

### L WRONG APPROACH (Creates Technical Debt):
```bash
# Creating new file without searching first
Write(file_path="new_feature.ts", content="...")
```

###  CORRECT APPROACH (Prevents Technical Debt):
```bash
# 1. SEARCH FIRST
Grep(pattern="feature.*implementation", glob="*.ts")
# 2. READ EXISTING FILES  
Read(file_path="existing_feature.ts")
# 3. EXTEND EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
Edit(file_path="existing_feature.ts", old_string="...", new_string="...")
```

## >ù DEBT PREVENTION WORKFLOW

### Before Creating ANY New File:
1. **= Search First** - Use Grep/Glob to find existing implementations
2. **=Ë Analyze Existing** - Read and understand current patterns
3. **> Decision Tree**: Can extend existing? ’ DO IT | Must create new? ’ Document why
4. ** Follow Patterns** - Use established project patterns
5. **=È Validate** - Ensure no duplication or technical debt

---

**  Prevention is better than consolidation - build clean from the start.**  
**<¯ Focus on single source of truth and extending existing functionality.**  
**=È Each task should maintain clean architecture and prevent technical debt.**
